This repository is a fork of an existing project that contains multiple violations of the SOLID principles. The goal of this project is to identify these issues, document them, and refactor the necessary parts to improve the overall design and maintainability of the code.

## **Objectives**
- Analyze the codebase and highlight violations of SOLID principles.
- Provide detailed explanations for each issue, linking them to specific principles.
- Implement refactoring techniques to improve code quality while preserving functionality.
- Apply relevant design patterns where needed to enhance scalability and maintainability.
